## Description

A backend framework for a social media network that stores data with a Mongo database

## Installation
No direct installation is necessary, but you must have node.js and MongoDB Compass installed on your system. The application also uses various dependencies which can be installed via the "npm install" command. Additionally, you will need a development browser (such as Insomnia) which can directly make GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.

## Usage
Install the necessary dependencies and use a development tool to test the various routes at localhost:3001. If deploying, follow that method's instructions.

## Known issues
-The application is still unfinished, so expect bugs and missing features
-Seed data currently doesn't function
-Database hasn't been fully configured with a DB name (you can do it yourself in line 4 of "/config/connection.js")
